# Chat bot

## Summary
What are you going to build? What does it do?
I am planning to bulid a Chatbot powered by a rasberry pi and a esp which answers you questions using chat-gpt and waves when ever it sees you

Why are you excited to build it?
I have seen a lot of chat bots but none of them move or wave its just there being a boring piece of plastic with AI

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
1. Order and receive (obviously)
2. Configure devices on local wifi
3. Make a esp server to handle the servos
4. Pi program to Recognize voice and its name
5. Requests to Chat-GPT
6. A tidy little body for our fellow robot ðŸ¤–
 I am going to use VSCode and a old monitor just in case with a portable wifi extender
